                <p>It helps add specifications and to beautify the web design.</p> 
                <p>CSS makes the frontend of a website shine and it creates a great user experience</p>

                 <i>Makes Updates Easier and Smoother</i>
                 <p>CSS works by creating rules.  These rules are simultaneously applied to multiple elements within the site. Eliminating the repetitive coding style of HTML makes development work faster and less monotonous. Errors are also reduced considerably.</p> 
    
                 <p>Since the content is completely separated from the design, changes across the website can be implemented all at once. This reduces delivery times and costs of future edits.</p> 
    
                 <p><i>Helps Web Pages Load Faster</i></p>  
                 <p>Improved website loading is an underrated yet important benefit of CSS. Browsers download the CSS rules once and cache them for loading all the pages of a website. It makes browsing the website faster and enhances the overall user experience.</p> 
    
                 <p> This feature comes in handy in making websites work smoothly at lower internet speeds. Accessibility on low end devices also improves with better loading speeds.</p>

              <i>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element </i> 
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
              <b> In general, margins are used when you’re adjusting the spacing of an element in relation to another element (i.e a div in relation to another div on the page), and padding when you’re adjusting the look of an individual element (i.e the amount of pixels between the edge of a div and the text within it).</b>
            
            <p>
                While the CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
